# Overview

In this assingment I was getting familiar with Android Studio. 

In this app, I created a button that when you click it "Hello" is meant to show up in the terminal. The user opens the app and clicks on the buton and it is done!

I did this to get used to Android Studio

# Future Work

* My original plan was to make three buttons and allow it to pop up "you found bean!" or "the bean is not in this door"
* I need to figure out how to get github working with Android studio
* I need to figure out what I don't understand about Android Studio and work on that
